What are the symptoms of covid	"The most common symptoms of covid are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell."	WJLA	2-May-20
How does covid spread	"People can catch covid from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with covid coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch covid by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch covid if they breathe in droplets from a person with covid who coughs out or exhales droplets."	WJLA	2-May-20
Can the virus that causes covid be transmitted through the air	Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes covid is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.	WJLA	2-May-20
Can covid be caught from a person who has no symptoms	The risk of catching covid from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. 	WJLA	2-May-20
What can I do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease	Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Maintain at least 3 feet distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.	WJLA	2-May-20
Should I wear a mask to protect myself	"People with no respiratory symptoms, such as cough, do not need to wear a medical mask. WHO recommends the use of masks for people who have symptoms of covid and for those caring for individuals who have symptoms, such as cough and fever."	WJLA	2-May-20
"How to put on use take off and dispose of a mask"	"Before touching the mask, clean hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water. Take the mask and inspect it for tears or holes. Orient which side is the top side (where the metal strip is). Ensure the proper side of the mask faces outwards (the colored side). Place the mask to your face. Pinch the metal strip or stiff edge of the mask so it molds to the shape of your nose. Pull down the mask’s bottom so it covers your mouth and your chin."	WJLA	2-May-20
How likely am I to catch covid	The risk depends on where you live or where you have travelled recently. The risk of infection is higher in areas where a number people have been diagnosed with covid. 	WJLA	2-May-20
Should I worry about covid 	"If you are not in an area where covid is spreading, or if you have not travelled from one of those areas or have not been in close contact with someone who has and is feeling unwell, your chances of getting it are currently low."	WJLA	2-May-20
Who is at risk of developing severe illness	"While we are still learning about how COVID-2019 affects people, older persons and persons with pre-existing medical conditions (such as high blood pressure, heart disease, or diabetes) appear to develop serious illness more often than others."	WJLA	2-May-20

How long does the virus survive on surfaces	"It is not certain how long the virus that causes covid survives on surfaces, but it seems to behave like other covides. Studies suggest that covides (including preliminary information on the covid virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days."	WJLA	2-May-20
Is it safe to receive a package from any area where covid has been reported	"Yes. The likelihood of an infected person contaminating commercial goods is low and the risk of catching the virus that causes covid from a package that has been moved, travelled, and exposed to different conditions and temperature is also low."	WJLA	2-May-20
"Is there a vaccine drug or treatment for covid"	"Not yet. To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019."	WJLA	2-May-20
